Django Contract
===============

Usually the work carried on the APIs is done simultaneously on the consumers and the API, this require a contract between them to ensure each part adheres to the requirements: a contract.

APIs should start from the most important part, and the cheaper to make: The documentation.

The purpose of the Django app is to generate a mock API from the RAML documentation.
